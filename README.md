## Matteo Spadetto

I am a PhD student working on categorical logic and homotopy type theory at the School of Mathematics of the University of Leeds, supervised by Nicola Gambino, Federico Olimpieri and Michael Rathjen.

My research topics are: (hyper)doctrines / fibrations; quantifier completions of doctrines / simple (co)product completions of fibrations; categorical semantics for (fragments of) first order logic; dialectica construction; propositional type theory; categorical semantics for type theories.
